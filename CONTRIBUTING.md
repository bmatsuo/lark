#Contributing to Lark

The Lark project is grateful for outside contributions.  Lark is maintained
through GitHub issues and pull requests.  This document outlines how the
maintainers use this system to manage development on the software.

##Issues

The easiest way to contribute is to comment on open issues and provide
feedback.  Feel free to open a new issue if you experience trouble that isn't
already addressed by an existing issue.

Bug reports or requests for documentation fixes and clarification are always
greatly appreciated. 

##Pull Requests

Pull requests must be related to an open issue.  If the issue is a feature
request, it must marked as "Help Wanted" or otherwise be assigned to you or it
will not be accepted.

A pull request must reference the issue by number in the description (e.g.
"Relates to #XX").  If the pull request completely resolves the issue than it
must explicitly state so as "Fixes #XX" or "Closes #XX" in the description.

##License Agreement

By submitting a pull request for this project, you are asserting that you have
the rights and agree to license your contribution under the MIT license to this
project.
